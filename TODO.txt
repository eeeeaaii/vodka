TYPE-RELATED TO DO
- figure out how to resolve orgs with multiple matching tags (first match?) and do we iterate first thru
  the tags in the expr being evaluated or first thru the tags on the org?
- figure out if it's an error if returned org doesn't have tag
- make builtin type checker operate off strings (i.e. make a type string parser)
- use the builtin argument type checker for lambdas also
- contract adherence check at tag assignment time with the tag builtin
- builtin that checks contract adherence
- implement tag checking in function params (single bracket [])
- implement tag checking WITH contract adherence (double bracket) 
- return value type checking
- setting '-' sets the return value
- functions that return nothing (i.e. -#?) - remove themselves from parent
- functions that return multiple values - put all in parent
- "do not eval" functions that always act like they are quoted the first time
- make it so braces inside tags are ignored [stuff in here]
- contracts that need to be implemented
- - equality
- - lambda type - exact match
- - lambda type - "invokable" (i.e. matches if less specific than, can be called on same args)
- - list-must-contain-exclusively: must contain given tags (or types) and no other tags (or types)
- - list-must-contain-nonexclusively: must contain given tags (or types), can have others
- - summary: something with tag Foo must have tags Bar, Baz, Qux
- - custom (runs code to see if nex satisifies)
(see TYPE_SYSTEM_NOTES.txt for more info)

TESTS TO-DO
- all tests may need to be re-recorded
- set up a unit testing framework that's not screenshot based
- make it so that async code can be screenshot tested (i.e. so the browser doesn't exit too early)
- re-do tests for builtins using unit testing framework
- make tests for copy and paste actions (cmd-c, cmd-v)
- need test for partial-exploded mode ,it doesn't work because esc is integral to my test recording framework
- I should have a test for each type of error location to make sure error propagation doesn't get broken. so basically any place that evaluateNexSafely is called
- builtins that need tests
- - run-js
- - equal
- - cram/chop
- - all async primitives
- - to-word/to-float
- - eval
- - others?

SERVER/FILES TO DO
- (fixed?) trying to load a file that doesn't exist crashes the server
- saving a file with an error in it only saves the top-level error not the enclosed errors.
- implement authentication/usernames/something and make it so each user saves/loads files from their private location
- make it so library files like util-functions, etc., are loaded from a global place that can't be modified, but that if you've done git pull and are modifying the source, there's a way you can pass a flag or something so that those files CAN be modified
- change the import builtin so it's like "import util" instead of "import util-functions"
- come up with a file extension for files and automatically add it on the server side
- make a pretty-printer util for nex files so they can be processed to be easier to look at in a text editor
- make parser tolerant of whitespace (so it can parse pretty-printed files)

RENDERING TO-DO
- handle insertion points at the render node level
- get rid of that carriage return object and use insertion point for that
- implement the thing where instead of having various types of renders, you just mark whatever is dirty as dirty, then call a function that renders whatever's dirty
- do "in place" rendering rather than deleting innerHTML and re-rendering (needs nexes to have three rendering functions - pre-render for dom nodes that precede children, actual render which draws children, and post-render for dom nodes that come after children)
- make certain visual things like width/height cachable in the nex itself so that builtins like get-width can just retrieve it rather than having to re-render the nex to find out its width
- make tags precede content for lists, come after content for atoms

CODE CLEANUP TO-DO
- make a better naming convention for js global variables
- fix render node hacks in estring class coming from the normal/expanded drawing logic
- remove dead code from eerror class because it can't be drawn in expanded mode anymore
- BuiltinParamManager and BuiltinArgEvaluator do the same thing, merge somehow

BUILTIN TO-DO
- figure out what to do in run-js if no DOM object (throw exception? create one?)
- figure out whether I should use exclamation point for primitives that change the value of things (like set!) as in regular lisp
- short circuit evaluation for conditionals
- implement cond
- implement to-word for lines and docs
- implement "equal" for list types (needs to be deep equal)
- make "type creation" primitives (make-integer, make-float, etc)

USER INPUT TO DO
- use regexes in the event table
- make "editor" classes for symbol, string, etc., similar to tags
- figure out key combination for "reopening editor"

PERFORMANCE TO DO
- instanceof checks are slow, for nexes instead compare to getTypeName()
- var is slow, use const or let

CUSTOM NEXES
- make a new list type actually called list that's equivalent to a word but can be re-oriented vert or horiz
- make doc/line/word into custom nexes
- - for doc type, make it so that you can type things like an exclaimation point without it inserting a boolean
- make custom nexes to implement sound/audio

EXPERIMENTAL
- make a list type that, when you evaluate it, replaces each of its children with the result of evaluating that child
- hook up playstation controller and try coding with it
- try voice commands
- make arithmetic functions use plus, minus words instead of +/- symbols
- try having different ctrl/alt/shift chords for insert/append/prepend/enclose versions of !@#$
- get rid of insertion points
